1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

- Server-side routing is done on the server, obviously, but more importantly when you send a request from the browser to a server-side route it unloads the current page and loads the page associated with the route. With client-side routing, the page doesn't refresh; it changes the state of the current page to match the route.
